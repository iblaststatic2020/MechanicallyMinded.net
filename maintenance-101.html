<h3>Maintenance 101</h3>

<p>
What is Maintenance 101? Great question! A major motivation for me
working on this site is to assist others in learning the trade of
mechanical maintenance in an industrial environment. I need to be clear
and up front about this. I am just a person trying to help other people.
I do have experience training people but this isn’t a college course,
more like a good beginners guide, a How to get started, a what to
expect at the start.
</p>
<p>
The sections I include here are intended to show you what you can expect
when you first apply for a maintenance position somewhere. Maybe you’re
getting hired on as a new hire or maybe you’ve been a production type
employee looking to move up to a higher paying maintenance job. 
Either way this area of the site is specifically tailored to you. The
rest of the site will also prove useful, but expect it to be more in
depth there. As time goes on I will include various maintenance 
tests I find from real plants as well as tests I’ll make up myself 
which are representative of what you’ll encounter.
