Welcome,
    This site is here to provide a way for me to play with several of
    my hobbies at once. I love learning about machines and how they
    work. I've spent nearly a decade as a military and industrial
    mechanic. I've learned many things over the years and I want to
    share that knowledge with others. This site also provides a way for
    me to dig in deeper to any topic I may have come across over the
    years. Sometimes you get caught up in the moment of needing to fix
    something and when you look back it is hard to figure out why you
    were having that issue or how your solution worked.
</p>
<p>
I've also always had a fascination with computers, the web, and how it
all works. I've run several sites over the years in attempts to assist
with some project or to further my comprehension of how various code
works. However, I've never undertaken a project on this scale. You see,
this site is attempting to merge these two passions.
</p>
<p>
I'm writing this entire site from scratch. A few of the tools I'll be
using are the Geany IDE, Firefox and Chrome browsers, git version
control, and of course I use Linux based operating systems on my
computer. The code that I write for this site will be totally had
written (or else put together by me using samples of free code online)
by me and will be available on GitHub for anyone to use. Software and
Code want to be free.
